# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository will include all of my HTML and CSS Projects for the Tech Academy.
The projects I am most proud of during this course are my space station website, and my movie theatre website.

The space station page is an example home page for a Space travel company. It is styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

The movie theatre website is an example home page for a movie theatre that is styled using bootstrap 4. It contains many bootstrap components including butt not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards and dropdowns.
